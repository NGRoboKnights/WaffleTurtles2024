# WaffleTurtles2024

We are the **Waffle turtles!** :waffle: :turtle:

The Waffle Turtles are a First Lego 
League team.  This year we chose to use
*Python* with our new Spike Prime 
robots and the Spike Prime version 3 app. 

Our FLL team would like to share some basic Python code for other teams to try it out and have an easy start on their Spike Prime robots.


> We had to overcome a lot of obstacles before we could be productive.  

We are providing some working examples in our github repository hoping that
we can jump-start you and your team to become productve with coding in Python.

To start, you will want to build a two-wheeled robot.  We are using LEGO's competition-ready
example robot with the distance sensor mounted on the front.  The wheels should go on ports A and E.

Copy the example Python code from our example directory and paste it into an 
empty Spike Prime python program -- just erase the code example they provide
when you open an empty project.

There are a lot of good Python tutorials out there, be sure to look at those
for help!  The Spike Prime API help on the right-hand side fo the screen will
explain more about each sensor and a bit of how to use them.

Rememember!  In Python, spacing is important!  Make sure things line up and are indented correctly.
